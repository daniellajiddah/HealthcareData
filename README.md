Healthcare Data Marketplace Smart Contract

Overview

The Healthcare Data Marketplace allows users to tokenize and sell their health data while maintaining privacy and control over who accesses their data. The platform implements permissioned access and rewards users through token-based transactions. Researchers can purchase health data with a native fungible token after receiving permission from data owners.

Features

	•	Data Ownership: Users have full control over their health data and can set a price for it.
	•	Permissioned Access: Only authorized and verified researchers can access purchased health data.
	•	Tokenized Transactions: The marketplace uses a fungible token (health-data-token) to handle payments for data.
	•	User Privacy: Data is registered using a hashed version to maintain user privacy.
	•	Admin Verification: Admins can verify researchers to grant them access to the marketplace.

Smart Contract Breakdown

Constants

	•	contract-owner: Refers to the owner of the contract.
	•	err-owner-only: Error for unauthorized actions by non-owners.
	•	err-invalid-data: Error when data is not found or invalid.
	•	err-unauthorized: Error for unauthorized access.
	•	err-insufficient-funds: Error when the payment does not match the required price.

Data Variables

	1.	user-data-registry: Stores user data, including:
	•	data-hash: A hashed version of the health data.
	•	price: The cost to purchase the data.
	•	is-available: Availability status of the data.
	•	access-control: List of principals (researchers) who have access to the data.
	2.	researcher-registry: Stores researcher information, including:
	•	is-verified: Indicates if the researcher is verified.
	•	purchased-data: List of data hashes the researcher has purchased.

Fungible Token

	•	health-data-token: The token used for transactions within the marketplace.
	•	The initial token supply is minted when the contract is deployed.

Functions

1. submit-health-data

	•	Allows users to submit their health data to the marketplace by providing a hash and setting a price.
	•	Updates the user’s data in the registry with availability status set to true.

2. register-researcher

	•	Enables a researcher to register for the marketplace.
	•	The researcher will initially be unverified.

3. verify-researcher

	•	Allows the contract owner (admin) to verify researchers. Verified researchers can purchase data.

4. purchase-data

	•	Researchers can purchase available health data by providing payment in health-data-token.
	•	The researcher’s access to the purchased data is recorded, and the payment is transferred to the data owner.

5. get-data-access-status

	•	A read-only function to check whether a specific researcher has access to a specific user’s data.

6. set-data-availability

	•	Allows the data owner to update the availability of their health data in the marketplace.

Error Codes

	•	u100: Unauthorized action (owner-only).
	•	u101: Invalid or non-existent data.
	•	u102: Unauthorized researcher access.
	•	u103: Insufficient funds for the transaction.
	•	u104: User already has registered data.

Setup and Deployment

To deploy and use this contract:

	1.	Mint Tokens: Upon deployment, 1 billion tokens are minted to the contract owner for marketplace use.
	2.	Register Users and Researchers: Users submit their health data, and researchers register to request access.
	3.	Admin Verification: The admin verifies researchers who wish to purchase health data.
	4.	Purchasing Data: Verified researchers can purchase data using the fungible token.

Permissions

	•	Contract Owner: Only the contract owner can verify researchers.
	•	Users: Users can submit health data and update its availability.
	•	Researchers: Researchers can register and purchase data, provided they are verified.

Testing

Ensure thorough testing of key scenarios:

	•	Health data submission, researcher registration, verification, and data purchases.
	•	Ensure unauthorized actions (like unverified researchers purchasing data) are blocked.
